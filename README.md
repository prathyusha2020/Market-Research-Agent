# Market-Research-Agent
This project implements a Market Research Agent designed to autonomously gather, analyze, and present actionable insights from high-level user queries. The system uses FastAPI for backend development, PostgreSQL for database management, and AI tools like OpenAI and LangChain for reasoning and automation.

## Technologies to Use:

Backend: FastAPI, AsyncIO, Pydantic
Database: PostgreSQL for data management
AI Tools: OpenAI (e.g., GPT-4) and LangChain for reasoning and task automation
Optional Bonus: Use a vector database like Qdrant to provide the agent with memory for retaining and recalling prior results.

## Features

- Accepts high-level user queries (e.g., "Analyze Competitor Xâ€™s digital strategy").
- Decomposes queries into sub-tasks.
- Collects data from mock sources and generates structured insights.
- Stores and retrieves insights using PostgreSQL.
- Provides REST API endpoints for querying and retrieving results.


## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.10+
2. PostgreSQL installed on your system
3. API key for OpenAI GPT-4

### Steps to Set Up

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```

2. Create a Python virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up PostgreSQL:

   - Install PostgreSQL on your system.
   - Create a new database named `market_research`.
   - Add a new user with a password and grant access to the database:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE market_research;
     CREATE USER user WITH PASSWORD 'password';
     GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE market_research TO user;
     ```

5. Update the `DATABASE_URL` in the code to reflect your PostgreSQL credentials:

   ```python
   DATABASE_URL = "postgresql+asyncpg://user:password@localhost/market_research"
   ```

6. Add your OpenAI API key in the code:

   ```python
   openai.api_key = "your_openai_api_key"
   ```

7. Run the application:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

8. Access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## API Endpoints

### Analyze Competitor

- **Endpoint:** `/analyze`
- **Method:** POST
- **Request Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "query": "Analyze Competitor X's digital strategy",
    "data": "mock data or description"
  }
  ```
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "query": "Analyze Competitor X's digital strategy",
    "insights": "Structured insights generated by the agent."
  }
  ```

### Retrieve Results

- **Endpoint:** `/results/{query}`
- **Method:** GET
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "query": "Analyze Competitor X's digital strategy",
    "insights": "Previously generated insights."
  }
  ```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **AsyncIO for Concurrency:** Ensures efficient task handling.
2. **PostgreSQL for Storage:** Chosen for robust and scalable data management.
3. **LangChain for Task Decomposition:** Automates query processing and reasoning.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate real data sources (e.g., social media, websites).
- Add support for a vector database like Qdrant for memory retention.
- Improve the UI with a web-based dashboard.
